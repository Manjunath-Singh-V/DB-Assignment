1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.


Answer:

The relationship between Products and Product_Category is one-to-many. A product can belong to one category (represented by the category_id foreign key in the Product entity), but a category can have many products. This is a common relationship in e-commerce databases, as it allows products to be grouped into logical categories for browsing and searching. For instance, a shoe store might have a category for "Men's Shoes" that contains all of the shoes that are targeted towards men.


2. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?

Answer:

There are several ways to ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it. The 2 ways I have learnt is that:

1. Database Constraints:

Foreign Key Constraint: This is the most common and reliable approach. You can define a foreign key constraint on the category_id column in the "Product" table. This constraint will reference the primary key (id) of the "Product_Category" table. This ensures that the value in the category_id can only be an existing category ID, preventing invalid assignments.

2. Data Cleansing:

Periodic Checks: Regularly run queries to identify products with invalid category_id values. You can then take corrective actions like assigning a default category, deleting the invalid product record, or notifying administrators.
